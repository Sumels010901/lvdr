#LVDR - Love Order
### What I mean?
Hi all, good day! <br>
As for studying purpose only, I have an idea of creating a webapp/Android/IOS app for couples that will fascinate their love stories. <br>

### Main features
Okay, let's look into what I want (or ideas): <br>
- Date Count (Of course, any lover don't want that?) <br>
- Suggest meaningful date for lovers.
- Simple messaging with your lovers/matches.
- You can order your lover to do something for you, or request for a date out.
- You and your lover schedule will be auto added to yours phone calender, and alarm. (Will this be legal, I don't want to steal your personal data or something)
- Track your lover to see where they are. (This gonna be tough)
- If you don't have a lover, then I will help you. (mini Tinder maybe? :D)

### Tech terms that I will learn
- Spring Boot Restful API for webapp backend
- ReactJS for frontend
- MySQL for database
- JWT for authorization
- Swagger for documentation
- Login with other platforms (Facebook, Google, Apple, ...)
- Google API for tracking position. (Is this even correct?)
- Websocket for realtime messaging
- ? for Android app.
- ? for IOS app.

### That's it for now. Will update more while doing, Cy@!
